In the New York metropolitan area, the county with the most new cases per capita in the last seven days is **`r recent_metro_nyt$county[1]` County**, where there have been an average of `r comma(recent_metro_nyt$new_cases_avg_7[1], 1)` cases per day reported in the past week (`r comma(recent_metro_nyt$new_cases_per_cap[1], 1)` per 100,000 residents). **`r recent_metro_nyt$county[2]` County** is another recent hot spot, with `r comma(recent_metro_nyt$new_cases_avg_7[2], 1)` average daily cases cases reported in the past week (`r comma(recent_metro_nyt$new_cases_per_cap[2], 1)` per 100,000). In **Westchester County**, `r comma(recent_nyt$new_cases_per_cap[1], 1)` cases per 100,000 residents have been reported in the past week (`r comma(recent_nyt$new_cases_avg_7[1], 1)` new cases per day).

Throughout the pandemic, the counties that have had the largest share of their population test positive for coronavirus are **`r tot_metro_nyt$county[1]`** (`r pretty_frac(tot_metro_nyt$tot_cases_per_cap[1])`) and **`r tot_metro_nyt$county[2]`** (`r pretty_frac(tot_metro_nyt$tot_cases_per_cap[2])`). The counties that have had the fewest cases per capita are **`r tot_metro_least$county[1]`** (`r pretty_frac(tot_metro_least$tot_cases_per_cap[1])`) and **`r tot_metro_least$county[2]`** (`r pretty_frac(tot_metro_least$tot_cases_per_cap[2])`). In **Westchester County**, `r pretty_frac(recent_nyt$tot_cases_per_cap)` residents have tested positive since the beginning of the pandemic.

The timing of outbreaks in counties in the New York metro area has varied. Some counties such as Rockland, Westchester, and Nassau had severe first waves in spring 2020. By contrast, other counties such as New Haven, Fairfield, Litchfield, had relatively mild first waves in the spring and more severe second waves in fall 2020. The chart below shows the number of cases per 100,000 residents from March 2020 through the present in each county.

## Racial disparities

<span class="recent-update">Most recent data: `r month_day_year(max(death_by_race$date, na.rm = TRUE), abbr = TRUE)`</span>

The Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color. Nationally, the COIVD Tracking Project estimates that [Black people are dying from Covid-19 at 1.7 times the rate of White people](https://covidtracking.com/race). Latino and Native people are also [dying more frequently](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/health_disparities.htm) from Covid-19 than white and Asian people. These national racial disparities are also evident in Westchester County. Black people make up `r percent(death_by_race$pop_pct[death_by_race$race == "Black"], 1)` of the total population of the county, but have accounted for `r percent(death_by_race$deaths_pct[death_by_race$race == "Black"], 1)` of Covid-19 deaths.

The disparities are even more stark when taking age into account. [Age-adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_adjustment) helps to compare groups by adjusting mortality rates for the different age distribution of each population. In Westchester, the median age of the white population is 48, while the median Latino person is 32 years old. The Black population is also younger than the white population, with a median age of 40. Because the white population is significantly older than the Black and Latino population, we would expect the Covid-19 mortality rate of white people to be higher than Black and Latino people.

<aside>
Since [older people are much more likely to die](https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age) from Covid-19 than younger people, it is important to adjust for age when making these comparisons. The process of age-adjustment allows you to compare groups as if they had the same distribution of ages in their population.
</aside>

In fact, we see the opposite. When accounting for the age of the white population in Westchester, `r comma(death_by_race$age_adjust[death_by_race$race == "White"], 1)` out of 100,000 people have died due to Covid-19. By contrast, `r comma(death_by_race$age_adjust[death_by_race$race == "Latino"], 1)` out of 100,000 Latinos have died and `r comma(death_by_race$age_adjust[death_by_race$race == "Black"], 1)` out of 100,000 Black people have died.

The chart below shows both the age-adjusted and crude (un-adjusted) death rates per 100,000 Westchester residents by race and ethnicity.

```

<span class="recent-update">Most recent data: `r month_day_year(max(wch_nh_sum$date), abbr = TRUE)`</span>

The Covid-19 pandemic has devastated long-term care facilities. The COVID Tracking Project estimates that [36% of all people in the US who died from Covid-19](https://covidtracking.com/data/long-term-care) were residents of long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

There have been `r comma(wch_nh_sum$deaths, 1)` confirmed or presumed deaths to due Covid-19 of nursing home residents in Westchester County since the beginning of the pandemic. This is `r percent(wch_nh_sum$deaths / wch_deaths$total_deaths, 1)` of all deaths reported in Westchester.

<aside>
Until Feb 2021, NYS was [undercounting deaths of nursing home residents](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/nyregion/new-york-nursing-homes-cuomo.html) because NYS DOH only reported deaths that occurred in nursing homes and not in hospitals.
