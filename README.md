# Westchester Covid-19 Tracking

This repository contains information about the Covid-19 pandemic in Westchester County, NY and the surrounding counties. The [Westchester County Department of Health website](https://health.westchestergov.com/2019-novel-coronavirus) does not contain much data or detailed information about the state of the pandemic in the county, so this repository and accompanying website hope to fill the gap.
