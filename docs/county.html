<p>The timing of outbreaks in counties in the New York metro area has varied. Some counties such as Rockland, Westchester, and Nassau had severe first waves in spring 2020. By contrast, other counties such as New Haven, Fairfield, Litchfield, had relatively mild first waves in the spring and more severe second waves in fall 2020. The chart below shows the number of cases per 100,000 residents from March 2020 through the present in each county.</p>

<!-- Since many schools in Westchester reopened for in-person learning in September, students and teachers have tested positive for coronavirus, which has led to some schools moving to remote-only learning temporarily. But in general, schools do not appear to be a major site of transmission. Since Sept 8, there have been 6,343 cases identified in students, teachers, and staff. This is 6% of all cases reported in Westchester during that time period. -->

<!-- The school district with the most reported cases is **Ossining School District**. There have been 422 positive tests reported of on-site students, teachers, and staff. The district with the second most reported cases is **Mamaroneck School District** with 343 cases. -->
<!-- In the *last 14 days*, the school with the most new on-site cases (students, teachers, staff combined) is **Benjamin Turner Middle School** in Mount Vernon with 1 cases. **Byram Hills High School** in Armonk has reported 0 new cases in the last 14 days. -->

<h2 id="racial-disparities">Racial disparities</h2>
<p><span class="recent-update">Most recent data: Jul 7, 2021</span></p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color. Nationally, the COIVD Tracking Project estimates that <a href="https://covidtracking.com/race">Black people are dying from Covid-19 at 1.7 times the rate of White people</a>. Latino and Native people are also <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/health_disparities.htm">dying more frequently</a> from Covid-19 than white and Asian people. These national racial disparities are also evident in Westchester County. Black people make up 14% of the total population of the county, but have accounted for 18% of Covid-19 deaths.</p>
<p>The disparities are even more stark when taking age into account. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_adjustment">Age-adjustment</a> helps to compare groups by adjusting mortality rates for the different age distribution of each population. In Westchester, the median age of the white population is 48, while the median Latino person is 32 years old. The Black population is also younger than the white population, with a median age of 40. Because the white population is significantly older than the Black and Latino population, we would expect the Covid-19 mortality rate of white people to be higher than Black and Latino people.</p>
<aside>
Since <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age">older people are much more likely to die</a> from Covid-19 than younger people, it is important to adjust for age when making these comparisons. The process of age-adjustment allows you to compare groups as if they had the same distribution of ages in their population.
</aside>
<p>In fact, we see the opposite. When accounting for the age of the white population in Westchester, 110 out of 100,000 people have died due to Covid-19. By contrast, 224 out of 100,000 Latinos have died and 210 out of 100,000 Black people have died.</p>
<p>The chart below shows both the age-adjusted and crude (un-adjusted) death rates per 100,000 Westchester residents by race and ethnicity.</p>
