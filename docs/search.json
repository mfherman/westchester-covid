The Westchester County government has created a dashboard that includes Covid-19 cases counts by municipality and current and historical county-level cases data. This site builds on the dashboard by providing per capita municipal case counts and historical data by municipality. In addition, this site includes data about Covid-19 in hospitals, schools, and nursing homes.\r\nData sources\r\nNew York State Statewide Covid-19 Testing\r\nNew York State Department of Health\r\nThis dataset includes the number of tests and positive cases of Covid-19 in New York State. The data is reported by county. It is updated daily and includes all tests reported by the end of the prior day. Tests include those administered by clinical laboratories as well as pooled or batch tests reported by colleges and universities.\r\nTests are assigned to a county based on the patient’s address. If that cannot be determined, the address of the health care provider who ordered the test is used.\r\nIf a person has multiple specimens tested on the same day, they are only counted as one test. If a person is tested on multiple days, each day’s test will be counted separately. An individual will only be counted positive one time, regardless of the number of positive tests that individual has.\r\nMost recent data: Apr 13, 2021  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: County (New York State only)  Where it’s used: New and total tests, new and total cases, test positivity rate\r\n\r\nCoronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States\r\nThe New York Times\r\nThis dataset includes the number of cases and deaths due to Covid-19 in the United States. The data is reported by county. It is updated daily and includes all cases and deaths compiled by Times journalists by the end of the prior day. The data is based on reports from state and local health agencies across the county and each state may have a slightly different reporting methodology.\r\nFor counties in New York State, the Times uses data reported by the NYS Department of Health. There is a one-day lag in the NYS data in the Times dataset. For example, data counted on December 16 by the New York Times was reported on December 15 by NYS DOH.\r\nBeginning August 6, the methodology for assigning deaths to counties in New York State was modified. Currently, deaths are assigned to the county of residence. Before August 6, deaths were assigned to county in which the death took place.\r\nMost recent data: Apr 13, 2021  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: County (United States)  Where it’s used: New and total deaths, new and total cases (metro area)\r\n\r\nWestchester County COVID-19 Dashboard\r\nWestchester County Department of Health/GIS\r\nThis dataset includes the number of Covid-19 cases in each of the 43 municipalities of Westchester County. It is updated on (most) weekdays and includes all cases in which a positive coronavirus test is associated with a confirmed address in Westchester County. With each update, the County posts the number of new cases, active cases, and total cases per municipality. The number of “active cases” refers the number of positive tests in the past two weeks.\r\nOften, the data reported by the county differs significantly from the data reported by NYS DOH. Given the lack of information shared by the Westchester County Department of Health about this data, I only use the County data to compare municipalities within Westchester. The data released by the County should not be directly compared to data released by the State or other sources.\r\nUnfortunately, the County does not currently post historical data. From early May until December 11, the County posted a map on most weekdays to the WestchesterGov Twitter account. I have extracted the historical cases data from the maps posted on Twitter. This extraction process is imperfect, but until more accurate historical data is released, this is best I can do. Extreme caution should be used when looking at municipal-level trends due to these limitations.\r\nOn Dec 23, 2020, the County released a dashboard that contains the same information that was posted on the daily map, with the addition of other metrics reported by New York State. This dashboard does not contain any municipal-level historical data either. Each day, I take a snapshot of the data reported on the dashboard to create trends for municipalities.\r\nI have decided to use the “active cases” metric as rolling 14-day average for most of the municipal-level on this site, as it seems to be the best balance between accuracy and recency If you or anyone you know works for the County, please encourage them to release more detailed historical data!\r\nMost recent data: Apr 13, 2021  Update frequency: Weekdays (usually)  Geographic aggregation: Municipality (Westchester County only)  Where it’s used: New and total cases\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by Facility\r\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\r\nThis dataset includes capacity and utilization of hospitals in the United States. It is reported on a weekly basis and provides facility-level information such as the number of total inpatient and ICU beds, the number of inpatient and ICU beds currently occupied, and the number of Covid-19 patients currently admitted to each hospital facility.\r\nThe data is derived from reports made by hospitals and state health departments to HHS. It includes hospitals registered with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, but does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities. There is a detailed community FAQ about this dataset that was developed by a group of data journalists, data scientists, and healthcare system researchers.\r\nOn this site, I use weekly average figures reported by the HHS dataset. In other words, this data is not a snapshot of hospital occupancy on a given day, but rather the average occupancy over the report week.\r\nHospital metric definitions:\r\nCovid-19 patients: patients currently hospitalized in an inpatient bed who have laboratory-confirmed or suspected Covid-19, including those in observation beds\r\nTotal beds: staffed inpatient beds including all overflow and active surge/expansion beds used for inpatients (including all designated ICU beds)\r\nBeds used: staffed inpatient beds that are occupied\r\nBed occupancy: beds used divided by total beds\r\nTotal ICU beds: staffed inpatient ICU beds\r\nICU beds used: staffed inpatient ICU beds that are occupied\r\nBed occupancy: ICU beds used divided by total ICU beds\r\nMost recent data: Apr 2, 2021 – Apr 8, 2021  Update frequency: Weekly (updates published Mondays)  Geographic aggregation: None (facility-level data, United States)  Where it’s used: Hospital capacity, occupancy, Covid-19 patients\r\n\r\nNew York State School Covid-19 Report Card\r\nNew York State Department of Health/New York Forward\r\nThis dataset includes the number of positive tests reported by each school in New York State. The numbers are broken down by students, teachers, and staff, on-site and off-site. Each school also reports their current teaching model (in-person, hybrid, or remote-only) as well as the number of students and staff currently enrolled on-site or working in school buildings and number of students and staff currently off-site.\r\nThe state does not currently publish historical data at the school-level, but rather the total number of cases reported by each school (since Sept 8) and the number of cases in the last 14 days. The data is reported daily by each school to the Department of Health.\r\nThe school data presented on this site includes positive cases in students, teachers, and staff that are attending or working in school buildings, and excludes “off-site” cases.\r\nMost recent data: Apr 13, 2021  Update frequency: Daily (varies by school)  Geographic aggregation: None (school-level data, New York State)  Where it’s used: Cases in schools\r\n\r\nFatalities by Race/Ethnicity\r\nNew York State Department of Health\r\nThis data includes Covid-19 death counts, crude death rates, and age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity for New York State and select counties in New York with large populations. It is updated daily, but the number of deaths by race lags the total number of deaths reported by the Department of Health in other places. For instance, on Dec 28, 2020, there were 1,314 deaths reported by race compared to 1,652 total deaths reported in Westchester.\r\nThe Department of Health does not make the data easily accessible outside their published Tableau dashboard, so I am not able to automatically update this data at this time.\r\nMost recent data: Feb 13, 2021  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: County (New York State, large-population counties only)  Where it’s used: Racial disparities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNursing Home and ACF COVID Related Deaths Statewide\r\nNew York State Department of Health\r\nThis dataset includes the cumulative number of confirmed and presumed Covid-19 deaths of nursing homes residents in New York State.\r\nBefore Feb 2021, it only includes deaths that occurred in nursing home facilities. If a nursing home resident died in a hospital, it was not counted as a nursing home death. Because of this limitation, the number of nursing homes deaths was undercounted in these numbers. There has been significant press coverage of this issue.\r\nIn Feb 2021, facing mounting pressure, including an inquiry from the New York State Attorney General and a court order in a Freedom of Information Law request, the state Department of Health began releasing new nursing home data that shows Covid-19-related deaths of nursing home residents that occurred in hospitals.\r\nThe number of beds in each nursing home comes from NYS Health Profiles.\r\nMost recent data: Apr 13, 2021  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: None (facility-level data, New York State)  Where it’s used: Deaths in nursing homes\r\n\r\nAmerican Community Survey\r\nUS Census Bureau\r\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) is conducted by the US Census Bureau on an ongoing basis and is used to estimate demographic, social, economic, and other characteristics of people and households in the Unites States. Approximately 3.5 million households participate each year.\r\nACS data is published at different levels of geographic aggregation including by state, county, census tract, and many other geographies. On this site, all county-level ACS data uses 2019 1-year estimates and all municipal-level data uses 2015 – 2019 5-year ACS estimates.\r\nIn order to create municipal-level estimates, I aggregate data from all the census tracts that are contained within each municipality’s boundaries. Most Westchester municipalities are composed of complete census tracts, but for the small number of census tracts that cross municipal boundaries, I assign the tract to the municipality that contains the largest proportion of the area of the tract.\r\n\r\nCode to download ACS data and create the municipal-level estimates is available on GitHub.\r\nTotal population Table B01003  The total number of people living in a county or census tract. This is used to estimate per capita rates of Covid-19 prevalence. Families below 200% of poverty line Table B17026  The percentage of families with a ratio of income to poverty level below 2. The US Census Bureau does not adjust the poverty line for the cost of living in a particular region. Given the high cost of living in Westchester County, I have used 200% of the poverty line when considering families in Westchester in poverty. The current poverty threshold for a family of four (two adults, two related children under 18) is $25,926. Any family earning less than $51,852 in year is below 200% of the poverty line. Overcrowded households Table B25014  There are a number of methods for measuring overcrowding in housing. The simplest and most common methodology is to divide the number of people living in a housing unit by the number of rooms in that housing unit (all rooms, not just bedrooms are counted). If the number of occupants per room exceeds one, then that housing unit is considered overcrowded. The percentage of overcrowded households is the number of housing units with more than 1 occupant per room divided by the total number of occupied housing units. Black or Latino population Table B03002  This measures the percentage of the total population that identifies as Hispanic or Latino of any race or non-Hispanic Black or African American. \r\nWhere it’s used: Per capita cases and deaths; socioeconomic factors associated with Covid-19\r\nMe\r\nThis website was built and is maintained by me, Matt Herman.

timing of outbreaks in counties in the New York metro area has varied. Some counties such as Rockland, Westchester, and Nassau had severe first waves in spring 2020. By contrast, other counties such as New Haven, Fairfield, Litchfield, had relatively mild first waves in the spring and more severe second waves in fall 2020. The chart below shows the number of cases per 100,000 residents from March 2020 through the present in each county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCases in school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost recent data: Apr 13, 2021\r\nSince many schools in Westchester reopened for in-person learning in September, students and teachers have tested positive for coronavirus, which has led to some schools moving to remote-only learning temporarily. But in general, schools do not appear to be a major site of transmission. Since Sept 8, there have been 5,713 cases identified in students, teachers, and staff. This is 7% of all cases reported in Westchester during that time period.\r\n\r\nHere and below, the numbers are “on-site” cases, which includes students, teachers, and staff who have tested positive and been in school buildings.\r\nThe school district with the most reported cases is Ossining School District. There have been 384 positive tests reported of on-site students, teachers, and staff. The district with the second most reported cases is Mamaroneck School District with 322 cases.\r\nIn the last 14 days, the school with the most new on-site cases (students, teachers, staff combined) is Somers Senior High School in Lincolndale with 17 cases. Briarcliff High School in Briarcliff Manor has reported 16 new cases in the last 14 days.\r\n\r\nNot all schools report to the state with the same frequency, so some schools’ data is more recent than others.\r\nSchools with more than 1 new case in the last 14 days\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.Positron\",null,null,{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addCircles\",\"args\":[[41.3126651,41.137,40.9410991,40.980778,40.99453015,41.068455,40.986885,41.3263291,40.928314,41.32533744,40.95814,40.93511,40.99364,41.330402,41.13319,41.171684,41.00404,41.124535,41.277843,41.018585,41.16696,40.979618,41.1727963,41.301384,41.13152,41.286057,41.354153,40.946625,40.96146,40.9670217,41.3128909,40.993423,40.9750241,41.27697,40.94445,41.27607,41.097256,40.95696,41.038063,41.019345,40.94754,40.94038,40.963795,41.178745,41.034794,41.063908,40.93036,41.299194,41.17459155,41.0401893,40.97461,40.91874,41.018436,41.003296,41.09088,41.11090451,41.097256,41.037807,40.926495,40.95696,41.3098482,41.0122849,41.207527,40.907005,41.216145,40.99676589,41.012955,41.073605,41.041245,40.943142,41.1961237,41.190514,40.994354,40.998497,40.926487,40.961028,41.03021,41.28663,41.010933,40.97337,41.018585,41.0401893,40.9689666,40.939568,41.1618464,40.904754,41.0837656,40.956203,41.1961237,41.326893,41.202126,41.0205638723404,41.137,41.07205,41.12953,40.9106259850289,41.010895,41.067883,41.0013946777542],[-73.7140546837215,-73.81195,-73.7438021172016,-73.73561,-73.7932681034856,-73.845795,-73.6827,-73.69469792,-73.793465,-73.69744427,-73.73771,-73.74753,-73.774475,-73.790504,-73.68595,-73.860977,-73.835304,-73.707016,-73.61119,-73.86951,-73.847496,-73.71295,-73.8586312,-73.687035,-73.860756,-73.92337,-73.593765,-73.78022,-73.81088,-73.715844,-73.87263358,-73.815094,-73.6870953,-73.61088,-73.762695,-73.85564,-73.77768,-73.71569,-73.747314,-73.839793,-73.82182,-73.75551,-73.796,-73.868935,-73.80951,-73.77615,-73.7529,-73.637596,-73.83361201,-73.8603358240439,-73.78464,-73.79831,-73.73829,-73.79018,-73.77722,-73.76482523,-73.77768,-73.748604,-73.81771,-73.71569,-73.7147908281284,-73.8673617,-73.88146,-73.78362,-73.65523,-73.8811129,-73.87184,-73.851703,-73.770645,-73.81041,-73.6619814,-73.79004,-73.87764,-73.81204,-73.828865,-73.717008,-73.808754,-73.91826,-73.679535,-73.805084,-73.86951,-73.8603358240439,-73.6836648,-73.75057,-73.8614266,-73.819868,-73.8575649,-73.80881,-73.6619814,-73.83752,-73.72754,-73.8339794255319,-73.81195,-73.860116,-73.77801,-73.8378343700931,-73.75367,-73.860466,-73.6748831428325],[1649.24225024706,1600,1549.19333848297,1496.66295470958,1496.66295470958,1385.6406460551,1326.64991614216,1200,1200,1131.37084989848,1131.37084989848,1131.37084989848,1131.37084989848,1058.30052442584,979.795897113271,979.795897113271,979.795897113271,979.795897113271,979.795897113271,979.795897113271,894.427190999916,894.427190999916,894.427190999916,894.427190999916,894.427190999916,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,692.820323027551,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238,565.685424949238],null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"className\":\"\",\"stroke\":true,\"color\":\"steelblue\",\"weight\":1.5,\"opacity\":0.7,\"fill\":true,\"fillColor\":\"steelblue\",\"fillOpacity\":0.2},null,null,[\"<b>Somers Senior High School -

disparities\r\nMost recent data: Feb 13, 2021\r\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color. Nationally, the COIVD Tracking Project estimates that Black people are dying from Covid-19 at 1.7 times the rate of White people. Latino and Native people are also dying more frequently from Covid-19 than white and Asian people. These national racial disparities are also evident in Westchester County. Black people make up 14% of the total population of the county, but have accounted for 18% of Covid-19 deaths.\r\nThe disparities are even more stark when taking age into account. Age-adjustment helps to compare groups by adjusting mortality rates for the different age distribution of each population. In Westchester, the median age of the white population is 48, while the median Latino person is 32 years old. The Black population is also younger than the white population, with a median age of 40. Because the white population is significantly older than the Black and Latino population, we would expect the Covid-19 mortality rate of white people to be higher than Black and Latino people.\r\n\r\nSince older people are much more likely to die from Covid-19 than younger people, it is important to adjust for age when making these comparisons. The process of age-adjustment allows you to compare groups as if they had the same distribution of ages in their population.\r\nIn fact, we see the opposite. When accounting for the age of the white population in Westchester, 96 out of 100,000 people have died due to Covid-19. By contrast, out of 100,000 Latinos have died and 179 out of 100,000 Black people have died.\r\nThe chart below shows both the age-adjusted and crude (un-adjusted) death rates per 100,000 Westchester residents by race and ethnicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"orientation\":\"v\",\"width\":[0.65,0.65,0.65,0.65],\"base\":[0,0,0,0],\"x\":[1,2,3,4],\"y\":[193.3,178.7,96.3,69.7],\"text\":[\"<b>Latino<\\/b><br>Age-adjusted

trends\r\nWestchester County does not currently publish historical data at the municipal-level, but I have reconstructed this data using maps posted on the WestchesterGov Twitter account. The earliest maps that included the number of active cases by municipality were posted in early May. As such, the data I have largely misses the first wave of the pandemic from March and April 2020.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unavailability of this historical data from the County, caution should be used when interpreting municipal-level trends.\r\nThe chart below shows the severity of the pandemic in each municipality by plotting the rolling 14-day average of new cases per 100,000 residents by day. The municipalities are ordered from top to bottom by their current average daily cases per 100,000.\r\n\r\nFor days with missing data, I have imputed the case numbers using linear

factors associated with Covid-19 prevalance\r\nIn the same way that the death rate from Covid-19 is Westchester County is higher for Black and Latino people than for White people, the total number of cases in the community is also correlated with socioeconomic characteristics. The risk of being infected with the novel coronavirus is higher for people of color due to factors including disproportionate representation in “essential” occupations, overcrowded and multigenerational households, and systemic discrimination and racism resulting in disparities in education and income as well as reduced access to high quality healthcare.\r\nThe scatterplots below illustrate the relationship between the total cases per capita in each municipality and three selected characteristics: poverty, overcrowding, and Black or Latino population. Each circle represents one of the 43 Westchester municipalities. Circles in the upper right-hand corner of each plot represent municipalities with high case rates and high levels of each socioeconomic variable. Municipalities with low case rates and low levels of each socioeconomic factor are in the bottom left.\r\nSee here for more information on how each of the socioeconomic variables is calculated.  The size of each circle is based on the total population of each municipality.\r\nThere is a strong positive correlation between each of the variables and the number of cases per capita. This suggests that the national trends of disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on disadvantaged communities also exists in Westchester County.\r\n\r\nHover over a circle to see which municipality it represents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[0.0589184826472962,0.114243635598569,0.0348209906817067,0.0554838709677419,0.107964601769912,0.0902861264727098,0.0651872399445215,0.0711678832116788,0.0599660569488969,0.180310880829016,0.090069479749195,0.0946649316851008,0.0567542213883677,0.0464547677261614,0.036783042394015,0.0531659096981031,0.016,0.13944878650761,0.153685964181591,0.0589539007092199,0.255035780545985,0.038550501156515,0.189570421030135,0.0441387216967613,0.105224429727741,0.0554821664464993,0.272258508078377,0.278863554107854,0.0858392564242756,0.0288935870331219,0.135774647887324,0.253069781371668,0.013801756587202,0.0431226765799256,0.0503364066782955,0.0362245924733347,0.25,0.0571133665921211,0.151546750086896,0.0999418942475305,0.199068006407456,0.277715754218187,0.0642835381334417],\"y\":[0.0915336879432624,0.0892546200078638,0.0915422885572139,0.0781713215790295,0.125233644859813,0.110952040085898,0.0923359901900674,0.115718157181572,0.110505252626313,0.16811527904849,0.101181327126608,0.0972098809312245,0.0756217649286706,0.0707612191759841,0.0820209973753281,0.0637352170807207,0.076961148230636,0.123068116771608,0.128566169703663,0.100046919551016,0.129212324731943,0.0611002513264451,0.14133582910696,0.0963628933387822,0.115540932843042,0.102879913059228,0.158694092322411,0.157092419522326,0.106324737069587,0.10253187286766,0.0940312976042099,0.162667848135778,0.0488700019316206,0.101718140613471,0.0874209860935525,0.0630711442507148,0.171579366660028,0.0935914739144599,0.131339629240993,0.105103280680437,0.12343258166056,0.139907385181629,0.115195139307023],\"text\":[\"<b>Ardsley<\\/b><br>Families
